## Summary

I am a graduate student pursuing a [Masters in Geography and Planning](https://www.appstate.edu/academics/graduate/id/geography-ma) at Appalachian State University. I have experience with RStudio, ArcGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, and am now learning the tools of web mapping! I've previously worked with the [Multimodal Planning Office](https://www.tn.gov/tdot/multimodal-transportation-resources/bicycle-and-pedestrian-program.html) in the Tennessee Department of Transportation on research and data visualization projects, and I hope to work in transportation or comprehensive planning after I graduate in May 2024.
